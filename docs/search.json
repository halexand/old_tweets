There is however, another assumption that is far more critical: independence. If there are correlations, or batch effects, then the results of the t-test (and pretty much any basic test you can think of) are unreliable\n\n\n\n\n2020-08-24 10:24:38 Retweets: 4 Likes: 61 1297842245501157377\n\n\nApplied to correlated data, the p-values from the t-test will be all over the place.

It has been proposed to fix it by using a test with less power. Maybe this works empirically in some cases, but conceptually, it seems odd, and poorly generalizable. /6\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-17 13:01:11 Retweets: 0 Likes: 3 1504442723671154699\n\n\n@AndrewHolding LogFC thresholds are important, but rather than applying one post hoc after test against a banded null, you can build it in upfront.\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-17 13:04:18 Retweets: 0 Likes: 1 1504443510275067907\n\n\n@holmrenser The issue is not whether the test is parametric or not, but the nature of the null hypothesis (point-like vs banded).\nPermutation-based approaches have been proposed, but they’re complicated if not intractable if you have more than two groups or more than one covariate.\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-17 14:10:04 Retweets: 0 Likes: 3 1504460058847072262\n\n\n@AndrewHolding See the DESeq2 vignette Section “Tests of log2 fold change above or below a threshold” https://t.co/AGu6PJUexd and the section about this in the DESeq2 paper.\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-20 11:41:43 Retweets: 0 Likes: 29 1505509890239963141\n\n\nCongratulations, Judith! @zauggj Great to see this exciting line of research expanding. https://t.co/cmx7yiCxaJ\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-23 15:07:31 Retweets: 15 Likes: 138 1506648844003651595\n\n\nPleased to learn that @EMBL-EBI is getting a 3rd building on the Wellcome Genome Campus, and that it’ll be named after Janet Thornton https://t.co/ikZ07omRCx\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-24 06:32:23 Retweets: 2 Likes: 10 1506881596028293120\n\n\nExciting opportunity for mathematical modellers, physicists et al. on important topic with great and energetic new PI! https://t.co/N3ZhDdvqOx\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-24 06:49:34 Retweets: 1 Likes: 8 1506885921135857665\n\n\nGermans in particular might consider amounts that are a multiple of what they have given to the Russian government via their direct and indirect fossil fuel consumption.\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-24 06:49:34 Retweets: 6 Likes: 15 1506885919789494284\n\n\nA reminder that you can donate to the Ukrainian army: https://t.co/uqhJOeAtPo or https://t.co/pbO1VDJAIR\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-26 16:38:54 Retweets: 2 Likes: 10 1507759006659579911\n\n\nPetition to the German government to stop importing Russian oil and gas imports immediately (rather than within months, as is their current plan).

Parametric t-test usually works surprisingly well even for data that are not normal distributed (try ‘breaking it’ by simulation). Where one needs to be careful is when measurement errors are correlated (aka batch effects).

In DESeq2, we do not ‘normalise’ counts, but model size factors explicitly (Eqn.(1) in https://t.co/TQfmzRhZ3m ). Having alpha_i be independent of j (and s_ij) is a model assumption.
