# Tweet archive

### Maintain a public archive of your old tweets that's independent of X, as a self-hosted static HTML webpage.

This R/Quarto script reads your tweet archive (as downloaded from X), extracts the tweet texts and 
associated media (pictures, movies) and outputs them into a static webpage.

See <https://wolfganghuber.github.io/tweets/> for an example.
